High-Level Function: The makeCoffee function represents the high-level abstraction. It outlines the sequence of steps required to make coffee.

Low-Level Functions: The boilWater, brewCoffee, pourCoffee, and pourMilk functions encapsulate the detailed steps of each part of the process. These functions describe how each step is done.

3. Readability and Maintainability: The code is structured in a way that makes it easy to read and understand. Each function has a clear responsibility, and the overall flow of making coffee is easy to follow.

The key things to archive this is to be mindful about the current level of abstraction and not mixed up high level abstraction and low level abstraction together.
