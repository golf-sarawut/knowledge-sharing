Explanation:

1. High-Level Function: The makeCoffee function represents the high-level abstraction. It outlines the sequence of steps required to make coffee.

2. Low-Level Functions: The boilWater, brewCoffee, pourCoffee, and pourMilk functions encapsulate the detailed steps of each part of the process. These functions describe how each step is done.

3. Readability and Maintainability: The code is structured in a way that makes it easy to read and understand. Each function has a clear responsibility, and the overall flow of making coffee is easy to follow.
